# Introduction
Contactless biometric fingerprint technology is one where a person can be identified and authenticated without physical contact with a scanning device. It has become essential in machine vision because it is efficient, secure, and easy to use. Frictionless contactless biometrics are more user-friendly. It allows users to authenticate their identity without the discomfort or hygiene concerns associated with touching shared surfaces.


# Abstract

The objective of this activity is to develop a contactless biometric fingerprint. Specifically, it aims to design the algorithm on which the contactless biometric fingerprint is working involved. Next, to develop using programming methods in Python, RoboFlow, and Pytorch for the contactless biometric fingerprint scanning. Lastly, to compare the fingerprints saved through qualitative methods. The Framework used in this activity is RoboFlow using YOLOv8 Model, a Deep Learning Framework to assist developers to develop real-time computer vision projects. The Scope of this project will focus on scanning and saving the fingerprint involved. The activity will not cover the recognizing the fingerprints needed involved.


# Project Methods

1. Using a suitable dataset for identifying the finger involved

2. Training a model using RoboFlow to identify the finger involved
