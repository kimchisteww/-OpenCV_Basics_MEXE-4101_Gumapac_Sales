# Introduction
Contactless biometric fingerprint technology is one where a person can be identified and authenticated without physical contact with a scanning device. It has become essential in machine vision because it is efficient, secure, and easy to use. Frictionless contactless biometrics are more user-friendly. It allows users to authenticate their identity without the discomfort or hygiene concerns associated with touching shared surfaces.


# Abstract
-Develop a contactless biometric fingerprint capture system using advanced imaging techniques.

-Conduct Edge Detection Analysis: Perform functionality tests on a contactless fingerprint scanning system to evaluate the effectiveness of edge detection algorithms across various fingers.

-Test Multiple Finger Types: Capture and analyze fingerprint images from different fingers (e.g., index, middle, ring, and pinky) of various individuals to assess the system's ability to detect edges consistently.

-Significant limitation of the current camera technology is its lack of autofocus capability.
